Final Computer Science Project:
Group members: Kwabena Kyereme-Tuah and Joey Morquecho

It is based on the second question of Hw5:
The program instatiates a mini town of Cornell that consists of 11 bulidings: Baker, Clark, Malott, Statler, Gates, Phil,
Duff, Olin, Health, Store, Day. The user can instantiate a Person class that is able to travel between the buildings and
choose their preferred mode of transportation which would have varying arrival times and cost and waiting time.
The program has the imported module "Pygame" which is the backbone of  the GUI representation of the town.

What the Program consists of:
The Program consists of a Transportation Network based on Dijsktra's algorithim
The Program consists of an Interactable Person Class
The Program consists of an abstract vehicle class with child classes: Car, Taxi, Bus and Bike
The Program has a perception of time for the person class
The Program consists of pocket money for the person class
The Program has a GUI representation of the town

Needed to do:
Show the images of the person moving from building to building
Display the text label of the buildings under the building
Needed to display the Time and Cost on the GUI
Have more User choice with the destination from the GUI
Basically needed more integration with the GUI and the actual backbone code of the code(Person,Vehicles,TransNeT)
